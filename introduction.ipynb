    "**_CRISP-DM_** is probably the most popular Data Science process in the Data Science world right now. Take a look at the visualization above to get a feel for CRISP-DM. Notice that CRISP-DM is an iterative process!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the individual steps involved in CRISP-DM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Business Understanding:_**  This stage is all about gathering facts and requirements. Who will be using the model you build? How will they be using it? How will this help the goals of the business or organization overall? Data Science projects are complex, with many moving parts and stakeholders. They're also time intensive to complete or modify. Because of this, it is very important that the Data Science team working on the project has a deep understanding of what the problem is, and how the solution will be used. Consider the fact that many stakeholders involved in the project may not have technical backgrounds, and may not even be from the same organization.  Stakeholders from one part of the organization may have wildly different expectations about the project than stakeholders from a different part of the organization -- for instance, the sales team may be under the impression that a recommendation system project is meant to increase sales by recommending upsells to current customers, while the marketing team may be under the impression that the project is meant to help generate new leads by personalizing product recommendations in a marketing email. These are two very different interpretations of a recommendation system project, and it's understandable that both departments would immediately assume that the primary goal of the project is one that helps their organization. As a Data Scientist, it's up to you to clarify the requirements and make sure that everyone involved understands what the project is and isn't. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this stage, the goal is to get everyone on the same page and to provide clarity on the scope of the project for everyone involved, not just the Data Science team. Generate and answer as many contextual questions as you can about the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Good questions for this stage include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Who are the stakeholders in this project? Who will be directly affected by the creation of this project?\n",
    "- What business problem(s) will this Data Science project solve for the organization?  \n",
    "- What problems are inside the scope of this project?\n",
    "- What problems are outside the scope of this project?\n",
    "- What data sources are available to us?\n",
    "- What is the expected timeline for this project? Are there hard deadlines (e.g. \"must be live before holiday season shopping\") or is this an ongoing project?\n",
    "- Do stakeholders from different parts of the company or organization all have the exact same understanding about what this project is and isn't?\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Data Understanding:_**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a solid understanding of the business implications for this project, we move on to understanding our data. During this stage, we'll aim to get a solid understanding of the data needed to complete the project.  This step includes both understanding where our data is coming from, as well as the information contained within the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following questions when working through this stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What data is available to us? Where does it live? Do we have the data, or can we scrape/buy/source the data from somewhere else?\n",
    "- Who controls the data sources, and what steps are needed to get access to the data?\n",
    "- What is our target?\n",
    "- What predictors are available to us?\n",
    "- What data types are the predictors we'll be working with?\n",
    "- What is the distribution of our data?\n",
    "- How many observations does our dataset contain? Do we have a lot of data? Only a little? \n",
    "- Do we have enough data to build a model? Will we need to use resampling methods?\n",
    "- How do we know the data is correct? How is the data collected? Is there a chance the data could be wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Data Preparation:_**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a strong understanding of our data, we can move onto preparing the data for our modeling steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this stage, we'll want to handle the following issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detecting and dealing with missing values\n",
    "- Data type conversions (e.g. numeric data mistakenly encoded as strings)\n",
    "- Checking for and removing multicollinearity (correlated predictors)\n",
    "- Normalizing our numeric data\n",
    "- Converting categorical data to numeric format through one-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Modeling:_**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have clean data, we can begin modeling! Remember, modeling, as with any of these other steps, is an iterative process. During this stage, we'll try to build and tune models to get the highest performance possible on our task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following questions during the modeling step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is this a classification task? A regression task? Something else?\n",
    "- What models will we try?\n",
    "- How do we deal with overfitting?\n",
    "- Do we need to use regularization or not?\n",
    "- What sort of validation strategy will we be using to check that our model works well on unseen data?\n",
    "- What loss functions will we use?\n",
    "- What threshold of performance do we consider as successful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Questions:\n",
    "* What decisions do I need to make regarding my data? How might these decisions affect overall performance?\n",
    "* Which predictors do I need? How can I confirm that I have the right predictors?\n",
    "* What parameter values (if any) should I choose for my model? How can I find the optimal value for a given parameter?\n",
    "* What metrics will I use to evaluate the performance of my model? Why?\n",
    "* How do I know if there's room left for improvement with my model? Are the potential performance gains worth the time needed to reach them?\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Evaluation:_**\n",
    "\n",
    "During this step, we'll evaluate the results of our modeling efforts. Does our model solve the problems that we outlined all the way back during step 1? Why or why not? Often times, evaluating the results of our modeling step will raise new questions, or will cause us to consider changing our approach to the problem.  Notice from the CRISP-DM diagram above, that the \"Evaluation\" step is unique in that it points to both _Business Understanding_ and _Deployment_.  As we mentioned before, Data Science is an iterative process -- that means that given the new information our model has provided, we'll often want to start over with another iteration, armed with our newfound knowledge! Perhaps the results of our model showed us something important that we had originally failed to consider the goal of the project or the scope.  Perhaps we learned that the model can't be successful without more data, or different data. Perhaps our evaluation shows us that we should reconsider our approach to cleaning and structuring the data, or how we frame the project as a whole (e.g. realizing we should treat the problem as a classification rather than a regression task). In any of these cases, it is totally encouraged to revisit the earlier steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, if the results are satisfactory, then we instead move onto deployment!\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Deployment:_**\n",
    "\n",
    "During this stage, we'll focus on moving our model into production and automating as much as possible. Everything before this serves as a proof-of-concept or an investigation.  If the project has proved successful, then you'll work with stakeholders to determine the best way to implement models and insights.  For example, you might set up an automated ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipelines of raw data in order to feed into a database and reformat it so that it is ready for modeling. During the deployment step, you'll actively work to determine the best course of action for getting the results of your project into the wild, and you'll often be involved with building everything needed to put the software into production."

However, if the value for `max_depth` is too low or too high, this may doom the model to overfitting or underfitting, by having a tree with too many arbitrary levels and splits that overfit on noise, or limiting the model to nothing more than a \"stump\" by only allowing it to grow to one or two levels. \n",

After creating the dictionary, all you need to do is pass it to `GridSearchCV()` along with the classifier.

    "The main drawback of an exhaustive search such as `GridsearchCV` is that there is no way of telling what's best until we've exhausted all possibilities! This means training many versions of the same machine learning model, which can be very time consuming and computationally expensive. Consider the example code above -- we have three different parameters, with 2, 4, and 4 variations to try, respectively. We also set the model to use cross-validation with a value of 3, meaning that each model will be built 3 times, and their performances averaged together. If we do some simple math, we can see that this simple grid search we see above actually results in `2 * 4 * 4 * 3 =` **_96 different models trained!_** For projects that involve complex models and/or very large datasets, the time needed to run a grid search can often be prohibitive. For this reason, be very thoughtful about the parameters you set -- sometimes the extra runtime isn't worth it -- especially when there's no guarantee that the model performance will improve!\n",

Learning rate is a tunable parameter for your model that you can set -- large learning rates get closer to the optimal values more quickly, but have trouble landing exactly at the optimal values because the step size is too big for the small distances it needs to travel when it gets close.

If they are on a page of a book they very much like, they will be happy to see another book that is similar to it. If they are told that this book is similar to their favorite book, they're more than likely to get that book. A disadvantage of content-based recommender systems is that they often require manual or semi-manual tagging of each of products.

    "##### Market Segmentation\n",
    "A regression analysis on last year's data can give you a general idea of how much you can expect to make overall, assuming that there aren't major differences between last year and this year. However, regression just tells you what you can expect _overall_ -- what if we're trying to optimize where we spend our money, rather than just predict what the returns will be, based on the overall amount of money we spent? By identifying **_segments_** in our customer data, we can look for trends that identify one group or another, and create personalized regression models for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, **market segments** are groups within our dataset with substantive differences between them. Clustering provides a great way for us to allow the data to tell us what is and isn't significant -- lest we get caught up chasing down market segments that aren't actually all that different -- or worse, don't actually exist at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "After we've identified the different market segments, the next step is to build individualized strategies to **_Target_** them! We should first start by answering questions such as \"which market segment is most valuable to us?\" This can be answered through research or through analyzing our data, or a combination of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third step in this process is a bit outside the scope of clustering. This is where the marketing team really shines -- figuring out how to position our product to make it both as desirable as possible to a given segment, while also making our product stand out from competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### K-Means Clustering\n",
    "**_K-means clustering_** is the most well-known clustering technique, and it belongs to the class of non-hierarchical clustering methods. When performing k-means clustering, you're essentially trying to find $k$ cluster centers as the mean of the data points that belong to these clusters. One challenging aspect of k-means is that the number _k_ needs to be decided upon before you start running the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-means clustering algorithm is an iterative algorithm that reaches for a pre-determined number of clusters within an unlabeled dataset, and basically works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select $k$ initial seeds \n",
    "2. Assign each observation to the cluster to which it is \"closest\"\n",
    "3. Recompute the cluster centroids\n",
    "4. Reassign the observations to one of the clusters according to some rule\n",
    "5. Stop if there is no reallocation \n",
    "\n",
    "Two assumptions are of main importance for the k-means clustering algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To compute the \"cluster center\", you calculate the (arithmetic) mean of all the points belonging to the cluster.  Each cluster center is recalculated in the beginning of each new iteration   \n",
    "2. After the cluster center has been recalculated, if a given point is now closer to a different cluster center than the center of its current cluster, then that point is reassigned to the closest center\n",
    "\n",
    "The best value of k is measured by the **_Variance Ratio_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _variance ratio_ is a ratio of the variance of the points within a cluster, to the variance of a point to points in other clusters. Intuitively, we can understand that we want intra-cluster variance to be low (suggesting that the clusters are tightly knit), and inter-cluster variance to be high (suggesting that there is little to no ambiguity about which cluster the points belong to).\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of the k-means clustering approach are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very easy to implement!\n",
    "* With many features, k-means is usually faster than HAC (as long as $k$ is reasonably small).\n",
    "* Objects are locked into the cluster they are first assigned to and can change as the centroids move around.\n",
    "* Clusters are often tighter than those formed by HAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this algorithm often comes with several disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quality of results depends on picking the right value for $k$. This can be a problem when we don't know how many clusters to expect in our dataset .\n",
    "* Scaling our dataset will completely change the results .\n",

    "##### Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)\n",
    "###### Linking Similar Clusters Together\n",
    "\n",
    "Several linkage criteria that have different definitions for \"most similar clusters\" can be used. The measure is always defined between two existing clusters up until that point, so the later in the algorithms, the bigger the clusters get.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn provides three linkage criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ward** (default): picks the two clusters to merge in a way that the variance within all clusters increases the least. Generally, this leads to clusters that are fairly equally sized.\n",
    "- **average**: merges the two clusters that have the smallest **_average_** distance between all the points.\n",
    "- **complete** (or maximum linkage): merges the two clusters that have the smallest **_maximum_** distance between their points.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAC is useful as a clustering algorithm because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It produces an ordered relationship between clusters, which can be useful when visualized.\n",
    "* It creates smaller clusters. This allows you to get a very granular understanding of the dataset, and zoom in at the level where the clusters make the most sense to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this algorithm is also built on some assumptions which can be disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Results are usually dependent upon the distance metric used.\n",
    "* Objects can be grouped 'incorrectly' early on, with no way to relocate them. For instance, consider two points that belong to separate clusters, but are both nearer to each other than the center of the cluster they actually belong to (both are near the \"boundary\" between their cluster and the opposing cluster). These will be incorrectly grouped as a cluster, which will throw off the clustering of the groups they actually belong to, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Evaluation\n",
    "An _elbow plot_ is a general term for plots like this where we can easily see where we hit a point of diminishing returns.\n",

    "\n",
    "So how to interpret this dendrogram? At the very bottom of the dendrogram, the data points are represented as individual clusters. Moving up, the first merged clusters start to form, starting with data points 12 and 15, and next data points 2 and 6, next 4 and 5, etc, until all the clusters are merged together. This along with the plot created through `plot_agglomerative()` gives basically a complete view of how clusters are created using the ward algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the y-axis next. The length of how far each branch is apart also shows how far apart the merged clusters are. If branches to go from $k$ to $k-1$ clusters are very long, it means that the merged clusters are far apart. It might then make sense to stick to $k$ clusters!\n",
    "\n",

    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "* There are two main types of clustering algorithms: non-hierarchical clustering (k-means) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering\n",

    "* Advantages of hierarchical agglomerative clustering include easy visualization and intuitiveness, whereas the main disadvantage is that the result is very distance-metric-dependent\n",
    "* You can use supervised and unsupervised learning together in a few different ways. Applications of this are look-alike models in market segmentation and semi-supervised learning"

    "#### Semi-Supervised Learning\n",
    "The main idea behind _semi-supervised learning_ is to generate **_pseudo-labels_** that are possibly correct (at least better than random chance). To do this, we don't usually use clustering algorithms -- instead, we use our supervised learning algorithms in an unsupervised way. The main benefit is that is helps companies generate more revenue, get more customers, or increase model performance without paying for more labeled training data!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to build a supervised learning model, and we have 100,000 observations in our dataset. However, labels are exceedingly expensive, so only 5,000 of these 100,000 observations are labeled. In traditional supervised learning, this means that in a practical sense, we really only have a dataset of 5,000 observations, because we can't do anything with the 95,000 unlabeled examples. However, with semi-supervised learning we can, using this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **_Train your model on your labeled training data_**. In the case of our example above, we would build the best model possible with our tiny dataset of 5,000 labeled examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **_Use your trained model to generate pseudo-labels for your unlabeled data_**. This means having our trained model make predictions on our 95,000 unlabeled examples. Since our trained model does better than random chance, this means that our generated pseudo-labels will be at least somewhat more correct than random chance. We can even put a number to this, by looking at the performance our trained model had on the test set. For example, if our trained model had an accuracy of ~70%, then we can assume that ~70% of the pseudo-labels will be correct, ~30% will be incorrect. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **_Combine your labeled data and your pseudo-labeled data into a single, new dataset._**. This means that we concatenate all our labeled data of 5,000 examples with the 95,000 pseudo-labeled examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **_Retrain your model on the new dataset_**. Although some of the pseudo-labeled data will certainly be wrong, it's likely that the amount that is correct will be more useful, and the signal that these correctly pseudo-labeled examples provide will outweigh the incorrectly labeled ones, thereby resulting in better overall model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Risks of Semi-Supervised Learning\n",
    "If a model trained only on the real data with no pseudo-labels got this example wrong, then what happens when you train the model on the same example, but this time provide a pseudo-label that \"confirms\" this incorrect belief? When done correctly, we can hope that the signal provided by all the correctly pseudo-labeled examples will generalize to help the model correct its mistakes on the ones it got wrong. However, if the dataset is noisy, or the original model wasn't that good to begin with (or both), then it can be quite likely that we are introducing even more incorrect information than correct information, moving the model in the wrong direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we make sure that we're not making these mistakes when using a semi-supervised approach? **_Use a holdout set!_** You should definitely have a test set that the model has never seen before to check the performance of your semi-supervised model. Obviously, make sure that your test set only contains actual, ground-truth labeled examples, no pseudo-labels allowed! Also, the noisier your dataset or more complicated your problem, the more likely you are to run into trouble with semi-supervised learning."

They are an important tool anytime we need to pull information from a larger text document without manually reading the entire thing. Regex is only as good as the **_Patterns_** we create. We can use these patterns to find, or to replace text.\n",
    "\n",
    " A **_Range_** such as `[A-Z]`. This will match any uppercase letter. Ranges are always inside of square brackets. We can put many things inside of ranges at the same time, and regex will match on any of them. For instance, if we wanted to find any uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit, we could use `[A-Za-z0-9]`.\n",
    "\n",
    " Groups are kind of like ranges, but they specify an exact pattern to match on. Groups are denoted by parentheses. Whereas `[A-Z0-9]` matches on any uppercase letter or any digit, `(A-Z0-9)` will only match on the sequence `'A-Z0-9'` exactly. This becomes much more useful when paired with **_Quantifiers_**, which allows us to specify how many times a group should happen in a row. If we want to specify an exact number of times, we can use curly braces. For instance, a group followed by `{3}` will only match on patterns that have that group repeated exactly 3 times. The most common quantifiers are usually:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `*` (0 or more times)\n",
    "* `+` (1 or more times)\n",
    "* `?` (0 or 1 times)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we can fill a grouping with any pattern, tell and specify the number of times we can expect to see that pattern. When we include things like ranges, groupings, and quantifiers together, it becomes easy to write a pattern that can match complex things, like email addresses -- note that this particular regex does not allow for numbers or special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`'([A-Za-z]+)@([A-Za-z]+)\\.com'`\n",
    "\n",
    "[regexr](https://regexr.com/) allows you to put in a block of text and test your patterns by quickly seeing visually what a pattern will grab out of the text block.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Vectorization\n",
    "The most common approach to working with text is to vectorize it by creating a **_Bag of Words_**.  In this case, the name \"Bag of Words\" is quite descriptive of the final product -- the bag contains information about all the important words in the text individually, but not in any particular order. If we have a number for every word, then we have a way to treat each bag as a **_vector_**, which opens up all kinds of machine learning tools for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to count how many times each word appears in this sentence, we would likely say that \"Apple\" has a count of three.  However, if we wrote a basic Python script to do this, our algorithm would tell us that the word \"Apple\" only appears twice! To a computer, \"Apple\" and \"Apple's\" are different words.  Capitalization is also a problem -- \"apple\" would also be counted as a different word. Similarly, punctuation is also a problem.  A basic counting algorithm would see \"stock\" and \"stock.\" as two completely different words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Stemming_** and **_Lemmatization_** help us deal with this problem, where we reduce each word token down to its root word.  For cases such as \"run\", \"runs\", \"running\" and \"ran\", they are more similar than different -- we may want our algorithm to treat these as the same word, \"run\".\n",
    "* **_Stemming_** accomplishes this by removing the ends of words where the end signals some sort of derivational change to the word.\n",
    "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-nlp-and-word-vectorization/master/images/new_stemming.png' alt=\"stemming rules and examples\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* **_Lemmatization_** accomplishes pretty much the same thing as stemming, but does it in a more complex way, by examining the **_morphology_** of words and attempting to reduce each word to its most basic form, or **_lemma_**.  Note that the results here often end up a bit different than stemming.  See the following table for an example of the differences in results:\n",
    "\n",
    "|   Word   |  Stem | Lemma |\n",
    "|:--------:|:-----:|:-----:|\n",
    "|  Studies | Studi | Study |\n",
    "| Studying | Study | Study |\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Stop Words_**, such as 'the' and 'of', are often removed after tokenization is complete in order to reduce the dimensionality of each corpus down to only the words that contain important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency_** (TF-IDF) is a more advanced form of vectorization that weighs each term in a document by how unique it is to the given document it is contained in, which allows us to summarize the contents of a document using a few key words. \n",
    "* If the word is used often in many other documents, it is not unique, and therefore probably not too useful if we wanted to figure out how this document is unique in relation to other documents.\n",
    "* Conversely, if a word is used many times in a document, but rarely in all the other documents we are considering, then it is likely a good indicator for telling us that this word is important to the document in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prodigy and spaCy\n",
    "**Prodigy** is a proprietary software thatimproves human-in-the-loop workflows for researchers building NLP models with their efficient and user friendly annotation tool. This eliminates some of the common challenges that researches face when building custom NLP pipelines and models, such as:\n",
    "* fair labor/security concerns from using MTurk or other HITS services\n",
    "* lack of domain knowledge from annotators\n",
    "* decision fatigue from human annotators that compromises data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why Prodigy's annotation tool is so powerful, is that it automatically selects edge cases from the labeled datasets and judiciously presents them to the human annotator. This means that the human annotator only has to label or correct a few edge cases to \"retrain\" the model. Prodigy is able to do this by using __similarity metrics__ and __blocking techniques__ to assess the similarity between examples. Examples that have the least in common with any of known data are classified as edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**spaCy** is designed specifically for production use and helps you build applications that process and “understand” large volumes of text. It can be used to build information extraction or natural language understanding systems, or to pre-process text for deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Text Data Summary\n",
    "Preproocessing text data is a bit more challenging than working with more traditional data types because there's no clear-cut answer for exactly what sort of preprocessing and cleaning we need to do. Here are some questions that can guide the cleaning process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do we remove stop words or not?    \n",
    "* Do we stem or lemmatize our text data, or leave the words as is?   \n",
    "* Is basic tokenization enough, or do we need to support special edge cases through the use of regex?  \n",
    "* Do we use the entire vocabulary, or just limit the model to a subset of the most frequently used words? If so, how many?  \n",
    "* Do we engineer other features, such as bigrams, or POS tags, or Mutual Information Scores?   \n",
    "* What sort of vectorization should we use in our model? Boolean Vectorization? Count Vectorization? TF-IDF? More advanced vectorization strategies such as Word2Vec?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there's no great answer for exactly which features will improve the performance of your model, and which won't. This means that your best bet is to experiment, and treat the entire project as an iterative process!"
